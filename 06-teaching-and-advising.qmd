# Teaching and Advising

Throughout my academic career, I have taught courses in economics, macroeconomics, finance, and data science at both undergraduate and graduate levels. My teaching philosophy emphasizes **applied learning**, with a strong focus on equipping students with practical skills in financial modeling, economic policy analysis, and programming for data-driven decision-making.

I place particular importance on helping students bridge theory and practice. In my courses, students work with real-world data, learn to communicate analytical results clearly, and develop the technical competencies needed for research, policy analysis, and industry roles.

## Advising and Mentorship

I have advised and mentored students on research projects across economics, finance, and data science. This includes guiding students through research design, empirical analysis, and the preparation of academic manuscripts. My goal is to foster **critical thinking**, methodological rigor, and independent problem-solving skills, preparing students for careers in academia, industry, and policy institutions.

Some of my course materials, assignments, and teaching resources are available on my
