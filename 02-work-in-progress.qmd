## Central Bank Information Effects and the Transmission of the Global Financial Cycle

**Authors:** Cory Baird, Jonathan Benchimol, Vira Vyshnevska, Iegor Vyshnevskyi, and Wook Sohn  

This project explores how **central bank communications** influence the transmission of global financial shocks to domestic financial conditions. By identifying and quantifying **central bank information effects** in advanced and emerging markets, we investigate their role as a key channel in the *global financial cycle*.

Using high-frequency surprises around monetary policy announcements and a novel text-based measure of central bank information disclosure, we find that information effects **amplify or dampen** the pass-through of global shocks depending on the **clarity, credibility, and independence** of the central bank.

The research highlights significant **heterogeneity** across countries and time periods, showing that stronger institutional frameworks allow central banks to steer market expectations more effectively and **buffer spillovers** from global financial conditions.

**Key Contributions:**
- Estimates the impact of central bank information effects on domestic bond yields, exchange rates, and equity markets.
- Constructs a novel dataset combining monetary policy communication, financial variables, and global risk indicators.
- Demonstrates the importance of communication transparency in reducing exposure to external financial shocks.

## The Global Database for Central Bank Communications

**Authors:** Cory Baird, Jonathan Benchimol, Vira Vyshnevska, Iegor Vyshnevskyi, and Wook Sohn  

We introduce the **Global Database for Central Bank Communications (GDCBC)**, analyzing over *6,000+ monetary policy statements* from *50 central banks worldwide*. This database fills a critical research gap by providing the **largest repository of standardized central bank communications**.

**Methodological Contributions:**
1. Developing standardized text preprocessing pipelines to ensure reproducibility in NLP analysis.
2. Implementing an integrated framework for training domain-specific language models.
3. Providing a robust technical architecture for automated data collection, version control, and cloud computing.

Using this dataset, we document significant **narrative convergence** during major economic shocks and identify systematic patterns in **global information effects** across diverse economies.
