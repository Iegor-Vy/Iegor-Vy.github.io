# About

I am currently an Assistant Professor of International Commerce at Sogang University, where I teach courses in international economics, macroeconomics, and finance. I hold a Ph.D. in Public Policy from the KDI School of Public Policy and Management, with a concentration in banking and central banking.

My academic and professional journey spans academia, research, and central banking. Prior to Sogang, I taught economics, research methods, and data science at Woosong University. Before transitioning to academia, I worked at the National Bank of Ukraine, focusing on financial modeling, systemic risk assessment, and banking policy development.

My research explores central bank communication, monetary policy transmission, nonperforming loans, and sustainable finance. I aim to bridge research and policy by integrating empirical analysis with real-world challenges in banking and regulation. I’ve published in peer-reviewed journals and contributed to international economic policy discourse.

I’m also passionate about using R and Python to promote data-driven decision-making in economics and finance. Through teaching and mentorship, I help students build analytical skills that support both academic inquiry and practical policy implementation.
