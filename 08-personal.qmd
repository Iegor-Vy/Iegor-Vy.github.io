## Personal

I live in South Korea with my family. Beyond academia, I enjoy practicing Hapkido, traveling, and listening to music. I am especially passionate about mentoring, cross-cultural education, and raising a bilingual (and even trilingual) child in a multicultural environment.

My professional journey spans academia, public service, and financial institutions—always guided by the belief that banking and finance should serve the greater good both locally and globally. I began my career at the National Bank of Ukraine, contributing to financial stability efforts, including risk assessment and macroprudential policy. My academic path brought me to the KDI School of Public Policy and Management, where I refined my research skills and deepened my policy expertise.

Following the completion of my Ph.D. in Public Policy, I transitioned fully into academia. I now teach economics, finance, and data science, working closely with students to develop analytical tools that inform impactful policy and business decisions. I remain dedicated to bridging the gap between academic research, real-world policy, and practical implementation.

Above all, I am deeply grateful for the extraordinary people who have shaped my path. I owe everything to the love and support of my family—my incredible wife and daughter—whose presence inspires me daily. I am also thankful for the sacrifices of my parents, relatives, friends, and mentors, whose unwavering belief in me continues to fuel my dedication to education, research, and using finance as a tool for positive change.
