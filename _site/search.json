    "text": "I live in South Korea with my family. Beyond academia, I enjoy practicing Hapkido, traveling, and listening to music. I am especially passionate about mentoring, cross-cultural education, and raising a bilingual (and even trilingual) child in a multicultural environment.\nMy professional journey spans academia, public service, and financial institutions—always guided by the belief that banking and finance should serve the greater good both locally and globally. I began my career at the National Bank of Ukraine, contributing to financial stability efforts, including risk assessment and macroprudential policy. My academic path brought me to the KDI School of Public Policy and Management, where I refined my research skills and deepened my policy expertise.\nFollowing the completion of my Ph.D. in Public Policy, I transitioned fully into academia. I now teach economics, finance, and data science, working closely with students to develop analytical tools that inform impactful policy and business decisions. I remain dedicated to bridging the gap between academic research, real-world policy, and practical implementation.\nAbove all, I am deeply grateful for the extraordinary people who have shaped my path. I owe everything to the love and support of my family—my incredible wife and daughter—whose presence inspires me daily. I am also thankful for the sacrifices of my parents, relatives, friends, and mentors, whose unwavering belief in me continues to fuel my dedication to education, research, and using finance as a tool for positive change."

    "text": "Authors: Cory Baird, Jonathan Benchimol, Vira Vyshnevska, Iegor Vyshnevskyi, and Wook Sohn\nThis project explores how central bank communications influence the transmission of global financial shocks to domestic financial conditions. By identifying and quantifying central bank information effects in advanced and emerging markets, we investigate their role as a key channel in the global financial cycle.\nUsing high-frequency surprises around monetary policy announcements and a novel text-based measure of central bank information disclosure, we find that information effects amplify or dampen the pass-through of global shocks depending on the clarity, credibility, and independence of the central bank.\nThe research highlights significant heterogeneity across countries and time periods, showing that stronger institutional frameworks allow central banks to steer market expectations more effectively and buffer spillovers from global financial conditions.\nKey Contributions: - Estimates the impact of central bank information effects on domestic bond yields, exchange rates, and equity markets. - Constructs a novel dataset combining monetary policy communication, financial variables, and global risk indicators. - Demonstrates the importance of communication transparency in reducing exposure to external financial shocks.\nPoster:\nASSA/AEA Annual Conference (January 3–5, 2026, Philadelphia, USA)"

This database fills a critical research gap by providing the largest repository of standardized central bank communications.\nMethodological Contributions: 1. Developing standardized text preprocessing pipelines to ensure reproducibility in NLP analysis. 2. Implementing an integrated framework for training domain-specific language models. 3. Providing a robust technical architecture for automated data collection, version control, and cloud computing.\nUsing this dataset, we document significant narrative convergence during major economic shocks and identify systematic patterns in global information effects across diverse economies.\nPresentation:\n4th IFC and Bank of Italy Workshop on “Data Science in Central Banking” (February 18–20, 2025, Rome, Italy)"
